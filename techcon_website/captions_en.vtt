at Google we are fully in our Gemini era
0:10
today all of our 2 billion user products
0:13
use Gemini Gemini 1.5 Pro is available
0:16
today in workspace Labs let's see how
0:19
this comes to life with Google workspace
0:23
people are always searching their emails
0:25
and Gmail we are working to make it much
0:27
more powerful with Gemini now we can ask
0:30
Gemini to summarize all recent emails
0:33
from the school maybe you were traveling
0:35
this week and you couldn't make the PTA
0:37
meeting the recording of the meeting is
0:40
an hour long if it's from Google meet
0:43
you can ask Gemini to give you the
0:45
highlights people love using photos to
0:47
search across their life with Gemini
0:50
you're making that a whole lot easier
0:53
and ask photos can also help you search
0:55
your memories in a deeper way for
0:58
example you might be reminiscent about
1:00
your daughter Lucia's early Milestones
1:03
you can ask photos show me how Luci
1:06
swimming has progressed here Gemini goes
1:10
beyond a simple search recognizing
1:13
different contexts and photos packages
1:15
it up all together in a
1:19
summary unlocking knowledge across
1:22
formats is why we built Gemini to be
1:24
multimodal from the ground up it's one
1:26
model with all the modalities built in
1:29
we have been growing rolling out Gemini
1:30
1.5 Pro with long context and preview
1:33
over the last few months so today we are
1:36
expanding the context window to 2
1:38
million
1:43
tokens so far we have talked about two
1:45
technical advances multimodality and
1:48
long context each is powerful on its own
1:52
but together they unlock deeper
1:54
capabilities and more intelligence but
1:57
what if we could go even further that's
1:59
one of the opportunities we see with AI
2:01
agents I think about them as intelligent
2:04
systems that show reasoning planning and
2:07
memory are able to think multiple steps
2:10
ahead work across software and systems
2:14
all to get something done on your behalf
2:17
and most importantly under your
2:20
supervision today we have some exciting
2:22
new progress to share about the future
2:24
of AI assistance that we're calling
2:27
project Astra for a long time we wanted
2:30
to build a universal AI agent that can
2:32
be truly helpful in everyday life here's
2:34
a video of our prototype which we'll see
2:37
has two parts each part was captured in
2:40
a single take in real
2:43
time what does that part of the code
2:47
do this code defines encryption and
2:51
decryption functions it seems to use
2:54
aebc encryption to encode and decode
2:57
data based on a key and an
2:59
initialization Vector
3:01
IV do you remember where you saw my
3:05
glasses yes I do your glasses were on
3:08
the desk near a red
3:16
apple uh give me a band name for this
3:22
Duo golden Stripes nice thanks Gemini
3:26
today we're introducing Gemini 1.5 flash
3:30
flash is a lighter weight model compared
3:32
to Pro it's designed to be fast and cost
3:35
efficient to serve at scale while still
3:37
featuring multimodal reasoning
3:39
capabilities and breakthrough long
3:41
context there's one more area I'm really
3:43
excited to share with you our teams have
3:45
made some incredible progress in
3:47
genitive
3:48
video today I'm excited to announce our
3:51
newest most capable generative video
3:53
model called vo vo creates high quality
3:57
1080p videos from text image and video
4:00
prompts it can capture the details of
4:03
your instructions in different Visual
4:04
and cinematic
4:08
styles for 25 years we have invested in
4:12
worldclass technical infrastructure
4:14
today we are exited to announce the
4:16
sixth generation of tpus called Trillium
4:20
Trillium delivers a 4.7x Improvement in
4:24
compute performance per chip over the
4:26
previous generation Google search is
4:29
generative AI at the scale of human
4:32
curiosity and it's our most exciting
4:34
chapter of search
4:37
yet all the advancements you'll see
4:39
today are made possible by a new Gemini
4:42
model customized for Google search what
4:45
really sets this apart is our three
4:47
unique
4:48
strengths this is search in the Gemini
4:51
era by the end of the year AI overviews
4:54
will come to over a billion people we're
4:57
making AI overviews even more helpful
4:59
for your most complex questions the type
5:02
that are really more like 10 questions
5:03
in one you can ask your entire question
5:07
with all its sub questions and get an AI
5:09
overview in
5:11
seconds I'm really excited to share that
5:14
soon you'll be able to ask questions
5:16
with video why will this not stay in
5:21
place and a near instant Google gives me
5:25
an AI overview I guess some reasons this
5:28
might be happening and steps I can take
5:30
to troubleshoot since last May we've
5:33
been hard at work making Gemini for
5:35
workspace even more helpful for
5:37
businesses and consumers across the
5:41
world now I can simply type out my
5:44
question right here in the Mobile card
5:46
and say something like compare my roof
5:49
repair bids by price and
5:51
availability this new Q&A feature makes
5:54
it so easy to get quick answers on
5:56
anything in my inbox today we'll show
5:59
you how how Gemini is delivering our
6:01
most intelligent AI experience we're
6:03
rolling out a new feature that lets you
6:05
customize it for your own needs and
6:08
create personal experts on any topic you
6:11
want we're calling these gems they're
6:14
really simple to set up just tap to
6:16
create a gem write your instructions
6:18
once and come back whenever you need it
6:21
starting today Gemini Advance
6:23
subscribers get access to Gemini 1.5 Pro
6:27
with 1 million tokens
6:30
that is the longest context window of
6:32
any chatbot in the world you can upload
6:35
a PDF up to 1500 pages long or multiple
6:40
files to get insights across a
6:45
project now we all know that chat Bots
6:47
can give you ideas for your next
6:49
vacation but there's a lot more that
6:51
goes into planning a great
6:53
trip it requires reasoning that
6:56
considers space time Logistics and the
6:59
intellig to prioritize and make
7:02
decisions that reasoning and
7:04
intelligence all come together in the
7:06
new trip planning experience in Gemini
7:09
Advanced we've embarked on a multi-year
7:11
journey to reimagine Android with AI at
7:15
the core now we're making Gemini context
7:19
aware so it can anticipate what you're
7:21
trying to do and provide more helpful
7:24
suggestions in the moment let me show
7:26
you how this works so my friend Pete is
7:29
asking if I want to play pickle ball
7:30
this weekend but I'm new to this pickle
7:32
ball thing and I can bring up Gemini to
7:34
help with that Gemini knows I'm looking
7:36
at a video so it proactively shows me an
7:39
ask this video chip so let me tap on
7:42
that and now I can ask specific
7:44
questions about the video so for example
7:47
uh what is the two bounce rule so give
7:52
it a moment and there I get a nice
7:55
succinct answer starting with pixel
7:57
later this year will be expanding what's
8:00
possible with our latest model Gemini
8:02
Nano with
8:04
multimodality this means your phone can
8:06
understand the world the way you
8:08
understand it so not just through text
8:10
input but also through sights sounds and
8:13
spoken language now let's shift gears
8:16
and talk about Gemma our family of open
8:19
models which are crucial for driving AI
8:22
Innovation and responsibility today's
8:25
newest member poly Gemma our first
8:29
Vision language open model and it's
8:31
available right now I'm also excited to
8:35
announce that we have gimma 2 coming
8:39
it's the next generation of Gemma and it
8:41
will be available in June so in a few
8:43
weeks we'll be adding a new 27 billion
8:46
parameter model to Jimma
8:52
2 to us building AI responsibly means
8:56
both addressing the risks and maximizing
8:59
and the benefits for people and Society
9:01
we're improving our models with an
9:03
industry standard practice called red
9:05
teaming in which we test our own models
9:08
and try to break them to identify
9:10
weaknesses I'm excited to introduce
9:13
learn
9:14
LM our new family of models based on
9:18
Gemini and fine-tuned for learning
9:21
another example is a new feature in
9:23
YouTube that uses learn LM to make
9:26
educational videos more Interactive
9:29
allowing you to ask a clarifying
9:31
question get a helpful explanation or
9:34
take a quiz all of this shows the
9:36
important progress we have made as we
9:37
take a bold and responsible approach to
9:40
making AI helpful for everyone to
9:42
everyone here in shine and the millions
9:45
more watching around the world here's to
9:47
the possibilities ahead and creating
9:49
them together thank you
